https://github.com/ramonjaspers/reactTestAddressBook/assets/17700948/61a21ed3-250e-452a-a424-b0818520272e

## Description

Try to finish as much TODO's as possible. This test is meant to give us insight in your skill level, so don't stress it if you didn't finish everything.

When you view the `/src` folder you will find an application for users that want to create their own addressbook (also shown in the video above). But as mentioned before there are some TODO's to be completed in order to make the application work as expected.

In order to start this assignment you need to:

- ⬇️ Clone or fork this repository
- 🌲 Create a separate branch called `feat/todo-assignment`
- 👨‍💻 Open up your preferred editor (mine is VS Code)
- 🏗️ install the deps using your fav package manager
- 🏃🏻 Run the app using your fav bundler
- 🔎 Implement the TODO's and resolve the erros and warnings in the project!

> Note: This test is developed for FM Group and should take about 4 hours, quality is more important than quantity.

## TODO's

Here is a list of all the TODO's to make life a bit easier:

### TS

- [x] There are some errors in the TS implementation, fix these errors to get the project running flawless.
- [x] Resolve all warnings.
- [x] Improve typescript usage, do minimize any usage.

### Styling

- [x] Add the 'Roboto' font from Google fonts and add it as a global CSS var called `--font-primary`.
- [x] Make application responsive. It is already for the most part, but it is not optimal for smaller screens.
- [x] Create separate styles for .primary and .secondary variants of the button component.

### React

- [x] Write a custom hook to set form fields in a more generic way.
- [x] Fetch addresses based on houseNumber and zipCode.
- [x] Create generic `<Form />` component to display form rows, legend and a submit button.
- [x] Create an `<ErrorMessage />` component for displaying an error message.
- [x] Add a button to clear all form fields. Button must look different from the default primary button, see design.
- [x] Add conditional classNames for `primary` and `secondary` variant in `<Button />` component.

### Redux

- [x] Prevent duplicate addresses.
- [x] Write a state update which removes an address from the addresses array.

## Submitting assignment

You can submit your assignment by creating a merge request for your `feat/todo-assignment` branch. That's it, good luck! 🚀
